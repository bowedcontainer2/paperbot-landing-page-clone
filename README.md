Hello Everyone! This repository is a build to learn group united for the purpose of futhering this team's knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS website creation!
Together, we are students of FreeCodeCamp and members of the Sloths Cohort, a group in the [Chingu Cohort ecosystem](https://tropicalchancer.github.io/projectus/).
For this project, we will attempt to reproduce the structure and functionality of this site: [paperbot.ai](https://www.paperbot.ai "paperbot.ai Homepage")
